        <p>
            In just under two weeks, <br /> I have met and attained a new family<br /> that hope will last a lifetime!
        </p>
        <font color="red"><h2> What They Mean to me</h2></font>
        <p>
            It goes without saying what one would do for their family.<br /> Each day I arrive,
            I look forward to seeing each and everyone of us.<br /> We all bring talents to the table that I value and thrive on.
        </p>

            <font color="red"> <h4>Who We are</h4></font>
        </section>
        <p>
            We are a mighty group of talented individuals from diverse backgrounds!<br />
            I dont believe that anything in life happens by chance,<br /> but that everyone is exactly
            where they need to be,<br /> to serve and walk in their present,<br /> at the current time.

        <font color="red"><h2>Moving Fearlessly Into the Future!</h2></font>
        <p>
            Entering this program  has been quite the experience thus far<br />
            You definitely have to decide quickly what matters most, YOU!<br /> Not everyone will
            be on board with you new way of life, but if taken for what it's worth<br /> everyone can walk away having earned a new
            skill in technology and a new family as well!
        </p>
